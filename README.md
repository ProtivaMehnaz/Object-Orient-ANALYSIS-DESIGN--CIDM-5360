A local library intends to modernize its operations and seeks your assistance in designing its system. The following are the requirements for the library system:
The library possesses a collection of books that can be borrowed by its members.
Each book has a unique ISBN, title, author, and publication year.
Members can search for books, check their availability, and place a hold on a book if it is unavailable.
When a book is available, the member can borrow it and the due date will be calculated based on the library's lending policy.
Members can return books, and the system should keep track of the books they have borrowed and the ones they have returned.
